abstract = {For a network of spiking neurons that encodes information in the timing of individual spike times, we derive a supervised learning rule, SpikeProp, akin to traditional error-backpropagation. With this algorithm, we demonstrate how networks of spiking neurons with biologically reasonable action potentials can perform complex non-linear classification in fast temporal coding just as well as rate-coded networks. We perform experiments for the classical XOR problem, when posed in a temporal setting, as well as for a number of other benchmark datasets. Comparing the (implicit) number of spiking neurons required for the encoding of the interpolated XOR problem, the trained networks demonstrate that temporal coding is a viable code for fast neural information processing, and as such requires less neurons than instantaneous rate-coding. Furthermore, we find that reliable temporal computation in the spiking networks was only accomplished when using spike response functions with a time constant longer than the coding interval, as has been predicted by theoretical considerations. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {AbstractBackground: All living organisms are made of individual and identifiable cells, whose number, together with their size and type, ultimately defines the structure and functions of an organism. While the total cell number of lower organisms is often known, it has not yet been defined in higher organisms. In particular, the reported total cell number of a human being ranges between 1012 and 1016 and it is widely mentioned without a proper reference.Aim: To study and discuss the theoretical issue of the total number of cells that compose the standard human adult organism.Subjects and methods: A systematic calculation of the total cell number of the whole human body and of the single organs was carried out using bibliographical and/or mathematical approaches.Results: A current estimation of human total cell number calculated for a variety of organs and cell types is presented. These partial data correspond to a total number of 3.72 Ã— 1013.Conclusions: Knowing the total cell number of the human body as ...},

@article{KosakovskyPond2006,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Phylogenetic and evolutionary inference can be severely misled if recombination is not accounted for, hence screening for it should be an essential component of nearly every comparative study. The evolution of recombinant sequences can not be properly explained by a single phylogenetic tree, but several phylogenies may be used to correctly model the evolution of non-recombinant fragments. RESULTS: We developed a likelihood-based model selection procedure that uses a genetic algorithm to search multiple sequence alignments for evidence of recombination breakpoints and identify putative recombinant sequences. GARD is an extensible and intuitive method that can be run efficiently in parallel. Extensive simulation studies show that the method nearly always outperforms other available tools, both in terms of power and accuracy and that the use of GARD to screen sequences for recombination ensures good statistical properties for methods aimed at detecting positive selection.

@inproceedings{Sanchez1997,
abstract = {Living beings are complex systems exhibiting a range of desirable qualifications that have eluded realization by traditional engineering methodologies. In recent years we are witness to a growing interest in Nature exhibited by engineers, wishing to imitate the observed processes, thereby creating powerful problem-solving methodologies. If one considers Life on earth since its very beginning, three levels of organization can be distinguished: the phylogenetic level concerns the temporal evolution of the genetic programs within individuals and species, the ontogenetic level concerns the developmental process of a single multicellular organism, and the epigenetic level concerns the learning processes during an individual organism's lifetime. In analogy to Nature, the space of bioinspired systems can be partitioned along these three axes, phylogeny, ontogeny, and epigenesis, giving rise to the POE model. This paper is an exposition and examination of bio-inspired systems within the POE framework. We first discuss each of the three axes separately, considering the systems created to date and plotting directions for continued progress along the axis in question. We end our exposition by a discussion of possible research directions, involving the construction of bio-inspired systems that are situated along two, and ultimately all three axes. This presents a vision for the future which will see the advent of novel systems, inspired by the powerful examples provided by Nature.},

@book{Darwin1859,
abstract = {In The Origin of Species (1859) Darwin challenged many of the most deeply-held beliefs of the Western world. Arguing for a material, not divine, origin of species, he showed that new species are achieved by `natural selection'. Development, diversification, decay, extinction, and absence ofplan are all inherent to his theories. Darwin read prodigiously across many fields; he reflected on his experiences as a traveller; he experimented. His profoundly influential concept of `natural selection' condenses materials from past and present, from the Galapagos Islands to rural Staffordshire, from English back gardens tocolonial encounters. The Origin communicates the enthusiasm of original thinking in an open, descriptive style, and Darwin's emphasis on the value of diversity speaks more strongly now than ever. As well as a stimulating introduction and notes, this edition offers a register of the many writers referred to by Darwin in the text.},

@book{Holland1975,
abstract = {Genetic algorithms were developed initially by Holland et al. in the 1960s and 1970s!!! Genetic algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in studies of complex adaptive systems, ranging from adaptive agents in economic theory to the use of machine learning techniques in the design of complex devices such as aircraft turbines and integrated circuits. Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements. John H. Holland is Professor of Psychology and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. He is also Maxwell Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and is Director of the University of Michigan/Santa Fe Institute Advanced Research Program.},
