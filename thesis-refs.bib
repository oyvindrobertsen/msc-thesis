abstract = {Can we realise the opportunities that lie in design by evolution$\backslash$nby using traditional technologies or are there better technologies which$\backslash$nwill allow us to fully realise the potential inherent in evolvable$\backslash$nhardware? The authors consider the characteristics of evolvable$\backslash$nhardware, especially for adaptive design, and discuss the demands that$\backslash$nthese characteristics place on the underlying technology. They suggest a$\backslash$npotential alternative to today's FPGA technology. The proposed$\backslash$narchitecture is particularly focused at reducing the genotype required$\backslash$nfor a given design by reducing the configuration data required for$\backslash$nunused routing resources and allowing partial configuration down to a$\backslash$nsingle CLB. In addition, to support adaptive hardware,$\backslash$nself-reconfiguration is enabled},

@inproceedings{Sanchez1997,
abstract = {Living beings are complex systems exhibiting a range of desirable qualifications that have eluded realization by traditional engineering methodologies. In recent years we are witness to a growing interest in Nature exhibited by engineers, wishing to imitate the observed processes, thereby creating powerful problem-solving methodologies. If one considers Life on earth since its very beginning, three levels of organization can be distinguished: the phylogenetic level concerns the temporal evolution of the genetic programs within individuals and species, the ontogenetic level concerns the developmental process of a single multicellular organism, and the epigenetic level concerns the learning processes during an individual organism's lifetime. In analogy to Nature, the space of bioinspired systems can be partitioned along these three axes, phylogeny, ontogeny, and epigenesis, giving rise to the POE model. This paper is an exposition and examination of bio-inspired systems within the POE framework. We first discuss each of the three axes separately, considering the systems created to date and plotting directions for continued progress along the axis in question. We end our exposition by a discussion of possible research directions, involving the construction of bio-inspired systems that are situated along two, and ultimately all three axes. This presents a vision for the future which will see the advent of novel systems, inspired by the powerful examples provided by Nature.},

@article{Sipper1999,
abstract = {The von Neumann architecture-which is based upon the principle of$\backslash$none complex processor that sequentially performs a single complex task$\backslash$nat a given moment-has dominated computing technology for the past 50$\backslash$nyears. Recently however, researchers have begun exploring alternative$\backslash$ncomputational systems based on entirely different principles. Although$\backslash$nemerging from disparate domains, the work behind these systems shares a$\backslash$ncommon computational philosophy, which the author calls cellular$\backslash$ncomputing. This philosophy promises to provide new means for doing$\backslash$ncomputation more efficiently-in terms of speed, cost, power dissipation,$\backslash$ninformation storage, and solution quality. Simultaneously, cellular$\backslash$ncomputing offers the potential of addressing much larger problem$\backslash$ninstances than previously possible, at least for some application$\backslash$ndomains. Cellular computing has attracted increasing research interest.$\backslash$nWork in this field has produced results that hold prospects for a bright$\backslash$nfuture. Yet questions must be answered before cellular computing can$\backslash$nbecome a mainstream paradigm. What classes of computational tasks are$\backslash$nmost suited to it? How do we match the specific properties and behaviors$\backslash$nof a given model to a suitable class of problems? At its heart, cellular$\backslash$ncomputing consists of three principles: simplicity, vast parallelism,$\backslash$nand locality},

In this work a virtual Sblock FPGA is implemented on an existing FPGA, achieving not only an architecture in keeping with cellular computing principles but also suited to biologically inspired design methods. The design method proposed is a combination of evolution and development and results of running a developmental model on the CCM are presented.},
