@article{Tufte2005a,
abstract = {Today's reconfigurable technology provides vast parallelism that may be exploited in the design of a cellular computing machine (CCM). In this work a virtual Sblock FPGA is implemented on an existing FPGA, achieving not only an architecture in keeping with cellular computing principles but also suited to biologically inspired design methods. The design method proposed is a combination of evolution and development and results of running a developmental model on the CCM are presented.},

abstract = {Can we realise the opportunities that lie in design by evolution$\backslash$nby using traditional technologies or are there better technologies which$\backslash$nwill allow us to fully realise the potential inherent in evolvable$\backslash$nhardware? The authors consider the characteristics of evolvable$\backslash$nhardware, especially for adaptive design, and discuss the demands that$\backslash$nthese characteristics place on the underlying technology. They suggest a$\backslash$npotential alternative to today's FPGA technology. The proposed$\backslash$narchitecture is particularly focused at reducing the genotype required$\backslash$nfor a given design by reducing the configuration data required for$\backslash$nunused routing resources and allowing partial configuration down to a$\backslash$nsingle CLB. In addition, to support adaptive hardware,$\backslash$nself-reconfiguration is enabled},
