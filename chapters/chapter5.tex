\figurename~\ref{fig:architecture-overview} shows a high level overview of the
CARP hardware platform extended with a readout module. While the system has been
extended with new functionality and partially ported to Chisel, the overall
architecture of the system has been largely preserved. In
\figurename~\ref{fig:architecture-detail}, a more detailed view of the system is
shown. Modules are annotated with either a C(hisel) or a V(HDL) in the upper
right corner to indicate their porting status. The top level logic and wiring
gluing all the modules together is all done in Chisel.

\section{Communication}

As outlined in section~\ref{sec:coproc}, the FPGA on the Convey coprocessor is
logically divided into Application Engines within which any custom logic can be
implemented. Each AE can communicate with the host, the on-board memory and
other AEs through various interfaces implemented by the Convey PDK, shown in
\figurename~\ref{fig:convey-ae-io-overview}. To be able to run the CARP hardware
platform on the coprocessor, the communication module has been reimplemented to
utilize these interfaces for data transfer.

  \label{fig:convey-ae-io-overview}
\end{figure}

\figurename~\ref{fig:convey-io-carp-overivew} shows how the CARP hardware is
implemented within the Convey AE architecture. The communication module has been
moved out of the main CARP module and rewritten from scratch. In an effort to
decouple the CARP platform from the underlying hardware and its communication
interfaces, the new module exposes two very generic interfaces facing
``outward,'' an Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)
\footnote{\url{http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ihi0024c/index.html}
(Requires registration)} and a memory bus, as shown in
\figurename~\ref{fig:comm-io}. These are specified fully in
Appendix~\ref{app:interfaces}. Using generic interfaces with established
conventions that are easy to connect to other communication interfaces makes it
easy to move the system to a different platform, should the Convey coprocessors
become obsolete or defunct.

    buffers, transmit and receive. Outwards, the communication module exposes two
    buses, an APB bus and a generic memory interface.
  }
  \label{fig:comm-io}
\end{figure}

To avoid having to rewrite the Fetch and Send Buffer Mux modules inside CARP,
the new communication module provides the same interface towards them as the old
one did; two data buffers, transmit and receive, buffer count signals and
read/write enable signals. Both data buffers are implemented as FIFO-queues with
counter registers and ready-valid access interfaces.

  \caption{State machine controlling the communication module.}
  \label{fig:comm-fsm}
\end{figure}

\figurename~\ref{fig:comm-fsm} shows the state machine controlling the operation
of the communication module. From the idle state, a transition to either the
Write or Read states can be triggered by asserting the PSEL signal on the APB
bus. Depending on wether or not the PWRITE signal is asserted, the state machine
will transition into the corresponding state. In this case, write refers to
writing data from the host to the receive buffer, and read refers to reading
data from the transmit buffer to the host. In the Write state, three bits in the
PADDR signal is used to further determine what is to happen. The possible
actions are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write PWDATA to Receive Buffer. Transition to Idle state.
\item Set starting address register to PWDATA. Transition to Idle state.
\item Set end address register to PWDATA. Transition to Idle state.
\item Prepare to start transferring data from memory to Receive Buffer.
  Transition to Write Memory state.
\end{enumerate}

In the Write Memory state, read requests are generated on the MemPort bus and
received data is stored into the Receive Buffer. The Read and Read Memory states
have similar functionality, but writes data from the Transmit Buffer either
directly to the APB bus or to memory. In general, transfers of five 32-bit words
or less are done via the APB, while larger transfers go via memory. This is
however something that is specified in the SDK, not implemented in hardware.
That means that the system can be implemented to run on platforms without
on-board memory, as the MemPort interface can simply be tied off in that case.

The ConveyApbBridge-module serves, as the name implies, as a bridge between the
interfaces provided by the Convey PDK and the Communication module. The Dispatch
interface drives the APB bus, while the Memory Controller interface is wired
against the MemPort.
